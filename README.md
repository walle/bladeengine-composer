Bladecoder Adventure Engine
===========================

Bladecoder Adventure Engine is a set of tools to create interactive graphic adventures (classical point ant click games).

I think that this type of games is a great medium to tell stories and the new mobile devices provides a big opportunity to rebird and evolve them.

By creating Bladecoder Adventure Engine, I want to create a platform to tell stories. Interactive stories with modern graphics, animations and music.

## Building

Make sure you have installed bladeengine first

    $ cd [bladeengine directory]
    $ ./gradlew install
    
Then to run

    $ cd venus
    $ ./gradlew run
